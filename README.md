# E-commerce-project
JtSpringProject Readme
1. Project Description
This is a Spring Boot project for Java Technology, likely an e-commerce or catalog management system, as suggested by the database schema.

2. How to set up and run your project
Prerequisites
Java 11: The project is configured to use Java 11.  Make sure you have it installed and configured correctly.
MySQL Database: The project uses MySQL to store its data. You'll need a MySQL server running.
Maven: Maven is used to build and manage project dependencies.  Ensure you have Maven installed.
IDE (Optional): An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse is recommended, but not required.  You can also use a text editor and command-line tools.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
git clone <your_repository_url>
cd JtSpringProject
Set up the database:
Create a database named ecommjava in your MySQL server.  You can use a tool like MySQL Workbench or the command-line client.
Run the basedata.sql script to create the necessary tables and populate them with initial data.  For example, using the MySQL command-line client:
mysql -u <your_mysql_username> -p ecommjava < basedata.sql
Replace <your_mysql_username> with your actual MySQL username.  You'll be prompted for your password.
Configure the database connection:
Open the src/main/resources/application.properties file.
Modify the following properties to match your MySQL server configuration:
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ecommjava?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
spring.datasource.username=<your_mysql_username>
spring.datasource.password=<your_mysql_password>
Replace <your_mysql_username> and <your_mysql_password> with your MySQL username and password.
Build the project:
Open a terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory (where the pom.xml file is located).
Run the following Maven command:
mvn clean install
This will download the project's dependencies and build the application.
Run the application
Run using Spring Boot:
After the build is successful, you can run the application using the Spring Boot Maven plugin:
mvn spring-boot:run
Alternatively, if you built the project into a JAR file, you can run it directly:
java -jar target/JtSpringProject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Access the application:
Once the application is running, you can access it in your web browser. The default configuration assumes the application will be running on http://localhost:8080.

3. Dependencies
The project uses the following main dependencies, managed by Maven:
Spring Boot Starter Web: For building the web application.
Spring Boot Starter Data JPA: For database interaction using JPA and Hibernate.
MySQL Connector/J: The MySQL JDBC driver for connecting to the database.
JSTL: JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library for use in JSP pages.
Tomcat Embed Jasper: For compiling JSP pages.
Spring Boot DevTools: Provides developer features like automatic restarts.
Spring Boot Starter Security: For implementing security.
These dependencies are declared in the pom.xml file.  Maven will automatically download them when you build the project.

4. Configuration
application.properties: This file contains the database connection configuration.  You'll need to configure it as described in the "Setup Instructions" section.
basedata.sql: This SQL script is used to create the database schema and insert initial data.  You should run this script against your MySQL database.
pom.xml: This file contains project metadata and declares the project's dependencies.  Maven uses this file to manage the build process.
.github/labeler.yml: This file is for GitHub Actions and is used to automatically label pull requests. It's not directly related to running the application.

5. Screenshots or Demo
Unfortunately, I cannot provide visual screenshots or a live demo, as I do not have the capability to run the application and interact with it.  To see the application in action, you will need to follow the setup and running instructions.  Once the application is running, you can access it in your web browser.  The basedata.sql file provides a basic idea of what the initial data and application are about.  It seems to be a simple e-commerce site.
